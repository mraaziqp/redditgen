I didn't realize until I got a reply 10 minutes later saying 'We need to talk about your internet usage.'\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!"

I politely declined because I had specifically chosen this seat. She called me selfish and several passengers glared at me.\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up! To clarify, she was in row 30 and I was in row 5."

        title: "My neighbor has been stealing my WiFi for 3 years - today I got revenge",

Then I created a wall of shame with all the sites they visited.\n\nEdit: Obligatory 'this is my most upvoted post' edit!"
